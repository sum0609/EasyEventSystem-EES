Project Methodology Statement - Islington Council Easy Events Application

Introduction
Islington Council is fostering a collaborative relationship with London Metropolitan University (London Met) that encompasses research, education, and various initiatives. Currently, Islington Council has commissioned London Met to develop an Easy Events Application System to assist and welcome organisers in organising events within the Islington Borough. London Met will leverage its academic expertise in research and planning, UI/UX design, web development, integration, quality assurance, as well as deployment. This project will also engage current and postgraduate students.
Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to ease the process of event planning and organisation, including scoping feasibility, carrying out risk assessments, making licencing applications, planning marketing and outreach campaigns and other aspects of event management. for local communities. The aim is to enable and increase community and cultural events in public spaces across the borough, particularly in the Archway CEZ area. The desired outcomes are as follows:

Reduce the complexity of the EventApp portal by developing and deploying the Easy Events App as a support tool.
Gather and present essential information from various council services to assist Islington community event organisers.
Guide users through event-related questions and risk assessment development as needed.

Scope
Gather information from council services regarding risks associated with community event applications.
Design a flowchart for various types of events, including related questions and answers.
Create the homepage and template theme for the Easy Events App.
Gamification of web UX design to implement the flowchart event scenarios, allowing the application to provide users with a wide range of event requirements, both indoors and outdoors, large and small scale.
Ensure compatibility with browsers and devices.
Ensure the app conforms to Islington Council accessibility requirements.
Implement validation checks to ensure accurate and error-free data entry, linking to existing relevant documentation and any up-to-dated documentation.
Provide advice based on user answers regarding:
1.Time
2.Budget
3.Main risks associated
4.Additional risks based on user requests
5.Impact and social value
6.Guidance on filling out the application
Where users lack experience, signpost them to appropriate event management training and opportunities to learn about event management.
Provide training for council officers to update information in the app in line with any changes over time to event training providers and opportunities or council policies and procedures.
Generate reports to assist users with event planning timelines and EventApp applications

The Scope Does Not Cover:
The main process is handled by EventApp. We will focus on the pre-application stage, preparing the client to submit the application and any other required supporting documentation including Risk Assessment/s.
Methodology
The project will employ an Incremental Prototyping approach, allowing for iterative development and refinement. We will seek council approval at various design and prototype stages. This methodology ensures continuous stakeholder feedback, resulting in a user-centric and adaptable system.
Tasks and Activities
Conduct several meetings to gather requirements from stakeholders and existing/future event organisers.
Develop flowchart functionalities.
Design UX/UI interfaces.
Implement core functionalities, including application frontend coding, specific feedback generation for user selections and risk assessments, and report generation.
Conduct testing and gather feedback from the council and users.
Deploy the system and provide post-launch support through documentation.
