# CSS Files

This folder contains all **stylesheets** used to define the visual appearance of the Easy Events Application.

## Structure
| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **main.css** | Global site styling, fonts, and color scheme |

## Guidelines
- Use **CSS variables** for colors and font sizes to maintain consistency.
- Ensure color contrast meets Islington Council accessibility standards.
- Keep separate files modular (e.g., donâ€™t mix layout and component styling).
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari (or more) before final deployment.
