# Assets

This folder contains all **static files** such as images, icons, and fonts used throughout the Easy Events Application.


## Guidelines
- **Optimize images** (use compressed PNG/JPEG or WebP for performance).
- Use **SVG icons** where possible for scalability.
- Fonts must be **web-licensed** and compliant with accessibility standards.
- Maintain a consistent naming convention (e.g., lowercase, hyphen-separated).
