# JavaScript Files

This folder contains all **client-side scripts** that power interactivity and logic within the Easy Events Application.

## Structure
| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **main.js** | Core script that initializes the app and handles global logic |

## Guidelines
- Comment your code to explain logic and decision points.
- All scripts should run without external frameworks unless approved (e.g., no jQuery unless required).
- Ensure compatibility across major browsers.
- Follow **ES6 standards** and prefer `const` / `let` over `var`.
